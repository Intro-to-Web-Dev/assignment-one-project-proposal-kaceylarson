<P>For this assignment, I want to make a websitre full of recipes. The website will be named "cooked" and it will have 3 different selections: salads, pastas, and desserts. All selections will have their own page.</P>
<h1> Things I want to achieve:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Introduce new cuisines</li>
    <li>Show a variety of food options</li>
    <li>Provide healthy recipes</li>
</ol>
<p>I choose this site because I like their layout as a whole. I think the pictures on the main page are appetizing and organized and I like how the list of categories have pictures as well</p>

<a href="https://www.allrecipes.com ">

<h1>Page one: Home Page</h1>
<p>For the home page, I want a semi-transparent picture of some sort of dish and to use modern type for the website name at the top. I want it the page to include a search bar, clickable categories, and top recipes.</p>
<h1>Page two: salads</h1>
<P>For the Salad page, I want to have some sort of filter button where you can display the recipes from beginner to advanced. 4 of the top rated salads will be at the top at all times. For each of the recipes, there will be a name, pictures of the salad, and a rating. </P>
<h1>Page three: Pasta</h1>
<p>Much like the salad page, the pasta page will have a filter and the top rated pasta dishes at the top of the page. The recipes will have a name, picture of the pasta, and a rating. There will be a link to another website explaining how to make your own pasta noodles at home.</p>
<h1>Page four: desserts</h1>
<p>The dessert page will have 2 sections to it, cake recipes and cookie recipes. Both sections will include pictures, names and rating of each recipe. The first recipe in each section will be the top rated recipe.   </p>
<h1>Target audience</h1>
<P>My target audience is pretty inclusive since every person makes food. If I had to narrow it down, it would be 30 years or older women. People would use this website for new, creative ways to make food. </P>
